\title{Response to the Reviewer's Comments}
\begin{document}

\maketitle

We thank the reviewers for this second round evaluation. Please, find below our replies and comments about each of the issues raised, and how we modified the paper to address them. The new changes are in blue in this version.

\begin{verbatim}
>> REVIEWER #1 <<

> The required improvement in the article was done. The only point that I am
> still waiting an answer is about the validation of the simulator. The authors
> argue that they have the real data and the the scenario but they will just do

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{In this new version, we included \textit{Section 4.3 - Quantitative evaluation of the simulated sonar image}. In this new section, we used two real-world scenes, which were modeled in our simulator. Both scenes were insonified with FLS and MSIS devices, both located approximately in the same pose with respect to the objects in the scene. The resulting sonar images (real and simulated) were compared by using five similarity metrics. An analysis of the metrics' results were carried out, too.}

\textbf{Thank you.}

\textbf{Modified.}

\begin{verbatim}

> ---> The beginning of those sentences sound strange.

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Modified.}

\begin{verbatim}
>
> -- lines 72-74
> "(...) we take advantage of precomputed geometric data during the rasterization
> pipeline to compute the acoustic frame (...)"
>

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Geometric data refer to the kind of information that composes the scene geometrically, that is, normals, colors, distances and angles. As the word "geometric" seems to have caused confusion, we just modified "geometric data" to simply "data".}

\begin{verbatim}

>
> -- lines 109-110
> "(...) until they hit any object or be completely absorbed."
>
> --> "(...) or are completely (...)."

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Modified.}

\begin{verbatim}

>
> -- lines 192-204
> The paragraph in lines 192-204 describes some technicalities, such as file
> formats (related to the use of the Rock-Gazebo framework), which are completely
> detached from the core discussion proposed in the paper. That discussion could
> be eventually removed.
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{We decided to keep this information to guarantee completeness in the paper.}

\begin{verbatim}
>
> -- lines 265-267
> "Normal mapping is a perturbation rendering technique to simulate wrinkles on
> the object surface by passing textures (...)."
>
> ---> "Perturbation rendering technique to simulate...", I've found this sentence
> a bit confusing since I have never seen the expression "perturbation rendering
> technique" associated to the normal mapping.
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Normal mapping is a rendering technique to simulate wrinkles and dents in object surfaces by perturbing the normal directions. The sentence "perturbation rendering technique" refers to a rendering technique with normal perturbation. We rephrased the sentence to be more appropriately related to the name normal: "Normal mapping is a rendering technique, based on normal perturbation, that is used to simulate wrinkles and dents on the object surface by using RGB textures on shaders".}

\begin{verbatim}

>
> ---> What does it mean "by passing textures"?

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{We modified this sentence to be more clear.}

\begin{verbatim}
>
> -- lines 404-405
> "(...) in order to provid enough (...)"
> ---> "provide"
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Modified.}

\begin{verbatim}
>
> -- lines 457-458
> "A GPU-based simulator for imaging sonar simulation was presented here."
> ---> Confusing.
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{We rephrased the sentence to be more clear.}

\begin{verbatim}

> Contributions and limitations
> =============================
>
> The abstract highlights the importance of simulating sonar sensors
> and introduce the new proposed method. However, once again, nothing is said
> about the difficulties involved in such a simulation, except for the high
> computational cost involved. Again, no mentions about the general limitations
> of the current methods and about the insights that led to the proposed method.
>
> From the abstract, it is not possible to say what sets the proposed method apart
> from the existing ones. For instance, in one sentence it is said that "Our
> system exploits the rasterization pipeline (...)". From this sentence, one
> cannot say if previous methods do, or don't, use the rasterization pipeline. If
> the exploitation of the rasterization pipeline is an exclusive feature of the
> new method, it should be stated. For instance "Differently from previous
> methods, the proposed technique exploits the rasterization pipeline (...)". In
> this case, it would be evident the difference with respect to previous works.
>
> -- abstract
> "(...) as well as generating realistic sonar image quality in different virtual
> underwater scenarios."
>
> ---> Realistic in which sense? Is it just visually convincent or numerically
> accurate?
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{The new Section 4.3 address the quantitative evaluation of the system.}

\begin{verbatim}

> The method
> ==========
>
> The authors have made a good job in rewritting the method and its implementation.
> It is, actually, a straightforward method, which employs a technique very
> similar to that of deferred shading. The main point, in this context, is the
> computation of the intensity values for the bins, which seems to be a
> contribution.
>
> Despite the method developed to compute the intensity of the bins, which seems
> to be new, and the general improvements in the structure of the paper, the
> general contribution of the paper is still diffuse for me. From
> the text, it seems that the premisse of the work was to develop a realtime sonar
> simulator targeted at interactive applications. New features would be
> incorporated into the simulator only if they would not affect interactivity.
> Thus, important effects, such as the reverberation, were not included because of
> their higher computational demands. The end result is a simulator that is fast,
> but that lacks accuracy.
>
> Usually, when a existing application is mapped to higher performance hardware,
> such as a GPU, it is expected the application to have its performance improved
> while still maintaining its core features. However, in this case, despite the
> use of a GPU, performance was improved at the cost of the simplification of the
> application.
>
> Decision
> ========
>
> I think that this work, in its current state, has potential to be accepted in a
> conference. It would be certainly a good opportunity to show the work to a
> broader audience and to start the discussion. However, for acceptance in a
> journal, I would expect a more sound contribution. For instance, the impact of
> this work would increase a lot if it would be able to handle reverberation
> and if some kind of validation could be also provided.
>
> However, in its current state, and from all that was previously discussed,
> I've decided for its rejection.

>> REVIEWER #4 <<

> As previously commented, the document is very well-written and organized,
> theoretically well supported, with a clear presentation and the experiments
> are sufficient to prove the system effectiveness.
> Although I believe this paper is ready to be published, satisfactory
> responses should be presented to the other reviewers' concerns before the
> final acceptance.
