Reviewer #1: The proposed work simulates underwater imaging sonar based on
OpenGL shading language (GLSL) chain, and is able to simulate two main types
of sonar sensors: mechanical scanning imaging sonars (MSIS) and forward-looking
sonars (FLS).

The paper is well written with just small issues like "there is any
previous work for comparison", "foward-looking sonars" or "the sonar simulator
can be by feature" that needs to be easily solved.
===> ROMULO COMMENTS <===: Done. The text was reviewed and typing errors were fixed.

The contribution of the work is interesting for the community, mainly if
the simulator will become freely available. It can increase the potential
of the work in terms of impact.

About the work, Figure 3 is confused and needs to be improved. The authors
argue that the beam are composed by the intensity, depth and angular
distortion matrix, however it is not clean in the figure. The names makes
the things hard, please "uniform the names", like "Beam Angle in Camera"
= "Angular Distortion"? "Surface Angle to Camera" = "Intensity"? "Distance
from Camera" = "Depth" ?

In Fig. 6, it is not clear the effect of the parameter "p". How does the
normal (blue channel) is adopted in the calculus of the acoustic intensity?
It is more readable to show the final simulation instead of the normal
image vs. depth image (green channel), as in Fig. 5.

About the simulation resolution, the number of bins are dependent of the
sonar's frequency and the adopted range. The authors know it, as shown in line
266, however it could be interesting to define the number of bins in terms of
these two parameters to make the simulation "more realistic" in terms of
the real sensor. It could be interesting for the community.

Another interesting thing is related to the noise simulation. It does not appear
realistic due to the lack of "noise" in the black areas. The application of
noise in this area can be interesting.

The main limitation of the work is the lacks of reverberation simulation in the
work. It limits the applicability of the simulation to open waters with a small
number of objects. Thus, it appears to be the "main future works", however, the
authors do not mention it.

It is hard to validate a simulator, however, I believe the works lake in
terms of comparison with real data at least in terms of SNR or other metrics.
It could be interesting to simulate a "real scenario" and compare the results
obtained by the simulator.

Reviewer #2: The paper proposes a complete simulation suite for real-time
underwater imaging sonar simulator. It seems to be a very broad proposal, that
includes many aspects of the simulation itself, going through the rendering
to the physical simulation itself. Acording to the authors, one main difference
of their work in relation to others is that they solve both mechanical scanning
imaging sonar (MSIS) and forward-looking sonar (FLS) models.

The results are promising and interesting. However, I am afraid that the
contribution is tangent to Computer & Graphics, even with a visualization
aspect being solved.

The Euclidean distance from camera center, the surface normal angles, and the
angular distortion are recorded as color channels. In this case, there is a
limitation of 256 values. Does this brings precision problems? Using CUDA or
OpenCL, couldn't this be addressed in a more elegant way?

I would like to see more details on the implementations of the models. I am not
sure if it is possible to reproduce the solution with the presented text.

This sentence seems to be from a decade ago paper…: Modern graphics hardware
presents programmable tasks…

It is unclear to me, but each beam is for a complete column?

Reviewer #3: The present work proposes a method for the simulation of sonar
sensors.
Differently from previous methods, the proposed technique takes advantage
of the GPU to achieve realtime performance and is able to reproduce the
operation of FLS and MSIS sonars sensors.


Text
====

The text contains some confusing passages that demand review. For instance:

--- lines 78-82
"The intensity measured back from the in-
sonified objects depends on the accumulated energy based on
surface normal directions, producing more realistic simulated
scenes, instead of statically defined by the user, as in [5], or in
a binary representation as found in [6, 7]."

---> "accumulated energy" refers to what exactly? Energy accumulated where?
---> "instead of statically defined by the user" What does it mean?


--- lines 172-174
"The Rock-Gazebo integration [17] provides the underwa-
ter scenario, and allows real-time hardware-in-the-loop simula-
tions."

---> What is "Rock-Gazebo integration"? The authors explain it later. However,
the order of the sentences could be switched to make text a bit clearer.


The Introduction section contains some text that should be in the
Related Work Section.


Technically, bump maps are different from normal maps. Bump maps are defined as
height maps that describes the bumps on parametric surfaces. Normal maps, on the
other hand, are textures that contain perturbed normal vectors. There are both
tangential and object space normal maps. It seems that the proposed technique
uses normal maps. I suggest a review on that.


Some image labels are too small.


No need to put "the {first|second|third|last} {scenario|scene}" in bold
on lines 322, 327, 334, 343, 347-348, 354-355.


Contributions and limitations
=============================


In the abstract the authors state the importance of simulating sonar sensors
and then introduce the proposed method. However, nothing is said
about the difficulties involved in such a simulation and about the general
limitations of current methods. Along the text, it seems that the use of the GPU
for sonar sensor simulation is a contribution, but this is not mentioned in the
abstract.


In the beginning of Section 1.1 (Contributions) we have:

--- lines 69-73
"This paper introduces a novel imaging sonar simulator, that
can overcome the main limitations of the existing approaches.
As opposed to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], where the proposed models
simulate a specific sonar type, our model is able to reproduce
two kind of sonar devices (...)"

---> These sentences may lead the reader to wrongly interpret the existing
techniques, that simulate only one type of sensor, as being limited although
they could even do it very accurately. Actually, it can be (and probably will
be) the case that the authors of the existing techniques were not concerned
about simulating several sonar sensor types. I think that this statements should
be reviewed and rewritten in order to correctly account for that.

---> The authors claim that the proposed technique overcomes the "main
limitations" of existing techniques. However, the proposed method itself
introduces limitations that were not present in some of the existing techniques
(for instance, the proposed method does not handle reverberation, an important
phenomenon in the context of sonar sensor simulation). Thus, I think that the
discourse about contributions versus limitations should be reviewed in order
to be fair.


The method
==========


The explanation about sonar sensors, and how they work, seems to be Ok. However,
I've missed a formalization of the problem being simulated. Without it, it
becomes difficult to understand how good the proposed simulation method is
(which were the simplifying assumptions adopted?). Also, the
description of the method implementation is quite confusing. I think that a grad
student could not implement it without too much guessing.


--- lines 74-78
"Also, the underwater scene is processed during the pipeline rendering on
graphics processing unit (GPU), accelerating the simulation process,
guaranteeing real-time simulation, in contrast to the methods found in
[1, 2, 4, 5]."

---> It is not clear why the GPU/rasterization were chosen and how the GPU
helps in overcoming eventual problems/limitations of the existing techniques.
Why GPU-based realtime ray tracing was not chosen, for instance?


The method takes advantage of the rasterization pipeline in order to build
the distance, normal and angle maps. This is not stated anywhere, but that
rendering method is similar to the "deferred shading" (which solves the
visibility from the camera viewpoint at the same time that stores several
properties of the rasterized fragments into an auxiliar buffer). This would
be one advantage related to the use of GPU in this context.


>From Section 2 (lines 104-107) it seems that bins are samples placed along the
beam. However, I could not spot how these samples are obtained from the
description in Section 3.3. Actually the text explains it, but I've found it too
confusing. In the beginning I had the impression that the distance, angle and
normal maps were 2D. Later on, I started thinking that they should be 3D
(what does "3D shader matrix" mean in line 257?). However, if they are really
3D maps, when is each slice of this 3D map (matrix) obtained? I've got really
confused at this point.


I've found the noise model too arbitrary. How good is this approximation?


Results
=======


--- lines 86-88
"The main goal here is to build quality and low time-con-
suming acoustic frames, according to underwater sonar image
formation and operation modes (see Section 2)."

---> The Results Section does not compare the obtained results with data
obtained with real sensors (validation). The proposed method is not even
compared to existing techniques (except for speed in some cases). Thus, despite
the fact that the proposed method can very efficiently simulate two distinct
types of sonar sensors, it is not possible to assert how good the results are
(quality).


--- lines 370-373
"In real sonar images, the noise also granulates the shadows and blind regions.
The sonar simulator can be improved by inserting an additive noise to our
model."

---> This seems to be a feature that could be easily included. Why it was not
added to the system?


Here I make an observation regarding the proposed technique. As was
mentioned in the paper, several existing techniques make use of the ray tracing
in order to simulate sonar sensors because reflection is extremely
important in the context of sound propagation simulation and it
can be easily simulated with ray tracing. Thus, how do the authors
plan to efficiently expand their rasterization-based system in order to handle
reflections? Wouldn't it be easier and more efficient with GPU-accelerated ray
tracing?


--- lines 373-375
"This lacking part can be addressed by implementation of a multi-path propaga-
tion model."

---> What does it mean "multi-path"? References?

Decision
========

The proposed work is very interesting but seems to be just in early stages
of development. Some decisions were not very well justified (why GPUs? why
rasterization?). Some explanations are confusing (the simulation of the sonars).
Certainly, with some additional work on these points, the paper will be ready for
submissions. However, in the current state, and from what was already discussed,
I've decided for its rejection.

===============================================================================

Reviewer #4: The submitted manuscript proposes a sonar simulator for real-time
applications. Several physical aspects are considered in a computational high
performance implementation. The final product is impressive.

With respect to the document, it is very well-written and organized, theoretically
well supported, the presentation is clear and the experiments are sufficient
to prove the system effectiveness. Everything is well justified and I do not
have any comment or question about the work. Congratulations.

Under these conditions, I believe the paper is ready to be published.
